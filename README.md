Intended for personal learning purposes. It is now just a simple, static html page
instead of nonsensical Node.js stuff (I can't code).

Blog is powered by Luke Smith's [lb](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb).

Don't mind the Illya pictures. I'm using them for my Discord server daily reminder. The 'illyarandom'
script is used to randomize a file, well "randomize".
