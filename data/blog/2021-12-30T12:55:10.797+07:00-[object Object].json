{"title":"Updates: Site simplification and Gemini","description":"<p>Since 2021 is ending, I want to simplify this site.</p><h2>What's changed</h2></p><p>Not much perhaps. However, I removed Bootstrap for, well, styling and client-side Luxon for timezone-agnostic blog timestamp. Yes, please mercy me, at least I now get it that I don't need such features. Additionally, if you've been here for a while, you might notice that there's no more Illya on the home page. I removed her (so sad) to save bandwidth and to make the site loads faster.</p><h2>Gemini</h2></p><p>Recently, I heard about the Gemini protocol that's deemed to be an alternative to HTTP and Gopher. I decided to try it out and eventually made a capsule (community term for 'site') there. You can visit it at <a href=\"gemini://niko.lapetite.moe\">gemini://niko.lapetite.moe</a>. My blog, and this site in general, won't be mirrored there because I think, at the end of the day, HTTP and Gemini are of different worlds. I still like HTTP because that's what everyone usesâ€”no need to get a special browser, no weird proxy, etc. However, my Gemini capsule will still be there and I will put different \"\"\"content\"\"\" from my main blog.</p>","date":"2021-12-30T12:55:10.797+07:00","pubDate":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 12:55:10 +0700","uri":"updates-site-simplification-and-gemini"}
