I'm not sure if it's POSIX-compliant, though. In addition, I'm not a shell wizard, so I got very confused initially.</p><p>But now, it's finished! I, and you Indonesian readers/watchers, can now read Risa Media, Media Formasi, and KANAU from RSS (I don't bother linking their sites here)!</p><p>You can check my script <a href=\"https://github.com/nikotile/wibu-rss\">here</a>.
