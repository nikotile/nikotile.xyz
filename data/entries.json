It reminded me of 10 years ago when the Sword Art Online TV series first aired. The early 2010s was, I think, one of the pivotal moments in weeb culture because it gave born to a new generation of, well, weebs. It sounds like a generalization but if we narrow it down to only <b>Indonesian weebs</b>, I know I'm right. Let's ignore the previous generation(s) and the recently born one during the pandemic.</p><p>What I like about these early 2010s weebs is that they know how to consume otaku media freely. They know how to use some Internet to hop between fansubs. Alternatively, hey, they know how to distinguish between download buttons that will really give them subbed anime or the one that will give them ads. Older weebs may have these \"abilities\" as well, but at the time they were already adults. That's not really impressive because adults should have those as basic Internet survival abilities. However, early 2010s weebs were mainly composed of teenagers. Therefore, if one of them was a <i>chuunibyou</i>, there's a chance if the person is a <i>chuuninensei</i> in a literal sense! Isn't it cool for them to be able to consume otaku media in a rather free manner? To choose one's favorite fansub, to choose a niche community to dwell in, that's the freedom of being a weeb.</p><p>The trends have changed nowadays, not to mention with the emergence of new groups of weebs during the pandemic. Most of them are at the mercy of big streaming services, or even worse a YouTube channel. It's because, according to my observation, they're afraid to consume anime from \"third-party sites\" or they don't know how to find them.</p><p>Time indeed flies, but oh well.</p><p></p>","date":"2022-01-13T15:37:11.353+00:00","pubDate":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 15:37:11 +0000","uri":"notes-on-early-2010s-weebs"},{"title":"Updates: Site simplification and Gemini","description":"<p>Since 2021 is ending, I want to simplify this site.</p><h2>What's changed</h2></p><p>Not much perhaps.

When I say \"homosexuality\", it's tied to the American-style identity politics rather than just a form of sexuality of the neurotics (you know where this is going).</p><p>However, what really happens in those two media, two pieces of fiction? Yes, it's true that there are same-sex relationships (romantic and not) in the two media. Or, for those who aren't ready to accept the previous, there are \"weirdly intimate friendships\" between the girls. Still, I don't think that the sexuality of these girls translates directly to our real-world situation about homosexual identity politics. Why is that? It's because fiction should be taken in its most literal state, that we should only take what's already on the surface: when there's no indication, leave it be.</p><h2>No Truth</h2></p><p>The Twitturd user stated most Honkai Impact players ignored the so-called subtext of the game, the \"subplots\" about relationships between girls. I think that's actually the safest way of consuming fiction, to take it literally. This doesn't mean that it's the only way of doing it. Some forms of interpretations are good ways to enjoy fiction, to indulge in its ecstasy. Considering Honkai Impact and Wonder Egg Priority as paragons of homosexuality falls under this. However, it's wrong if we assume that by doing interpretations, we can arrive at the \"truth\" about the questioned fiction. Interpretations will never provide us with \"truth\".</p><p>The only \"truth\" we can access about fiction is that there is no hidden truth. There's this illusion that we must unveil a certain mask to access some sort of raw or pure knowledge. This is, I think, a form of human's most basic instinct: to desire something unknown, to desire more and more. We're expecting some fiction to hold hidden meaning, that is our desire. The problem arises when we're presented that there's nothing behind them. We will keep denying it, keep saying that \"it is not it!\" because we don't understand what we want in the first place and yet, we want more and more. It is, then, only natural for us to hide from this shock by constructing our own \"truth\" about the questioned fiction so that we can enjoy more, free from the deadlock of nothingness. When we do this, we enter what I previously call \"interpretations\".</p><h2>Fiction and Reality</h2></p><p>Another reason for the tendency to do interpretations is also rooted in our way of thinking that fiction is just fiction, something that isn't \"real\". The case would be different if someone didn't privilege the so-called everyday reality over fiction, if one saw fiction as another \"reality\", or in other words: if one saw that reality is just another fiction. This might be hard to accept and at first, this seems like blending reality with fiction. However, I'd say that someone who dismisses fiction that easily is in fact the one who confuses reality with fiction. In contrast, someone who privileges neither is the one who could distinguish the two. How does this work? By being aware that fiction is an autonomous realm of its own, they are safe in investing their mental energy in the two (or even more) realities. For them, then, fiction isn't a direct representative of real-world situations. It's neither their desire for a certain real-world situation to happen. For them, fiction is an authentic experience. Meanwhile, someone who privileges everyday reality over fiction is often lost. They're too quick to dismiss fiction that what's inside it must translate directly to some \"real\" social conditions. That's why they proceeded to do interpretations.</p><p>Indeed, it's easy to fall into the temptation to see fiction as reflections of reality. An example is seeing the rise of mahou shoujo trope as a sign of young girl empowerment, commonly seen in the realm of feminist academia. Mahou shoujo is a strong girl, not a damsel in distress. She isn't passive and often not subjected to the common norm of what a girl should be. It's tempting to see her as a paragon of young girl empowerment here. However, if we aren't very oblivious, we can see that mahou shoujo is often highly sexualized too. Is mahou shoujo then an indicator that young girls are sexually mistreated in real-world situations? I don't think either way of seeing mahou shoujo is correct because, again, fiction doesn't directly reflect some social situations. By not privileging everyday reality over fiction, one can see mahou shoujo as an independent \"object\" in another reality.</p><h2>Abrahamic Influence</h2></p><p>Is it too farfetched to say that Abrahamic religions influenced the global community, notably the West, to privilege everyday reality over fiction and to do what I previously call interpretations? The problem isn't \"grow up and accept reality lmao\". Rather, it's related to the anxiousness of the adherents of the Abrahamic religions about God. Firstly, God is unimaginable, and secondly, creating idols is forbidden. This led them to create and enjoy something (fiction) with excessive care. I'm not really confident with this myself but that's enough of that.</p><p>Lastly, I want to go back to interpretations once again and say \"enjoy!\" because I don't think any normal human can elude the nothingness behind fiction. And to the gentlemen of the jury, let us see how much of this zoomer thought will change in the next few years.</p>","date":"2021-12-15T17:35:02.895+07:00","pubDate":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 17:35:02 +0700","uri":"a-zoomer-thought-on-fiction-and-reality"},{"title":"Updates, Love, and Other Delusions","description":"<p>Here are several updates from me regarding this website, my YouTube channel, and a certain project.</p><h2>Website</h2></p><p>I'm updating my website soon.

The joke goes like this: if a vtuber stands for \"virtual YouTuber\", every YouTuber is a vtuber! How could they not be? What we see is just an aggregate of pixels, not the real person! Indeed, that is just a joke, a stupid and trivial joke even. However, it is possible for someone to take it seriously.</p><p>I'm not that much of a vtuber fan. What I know is that vtuber has been there since the ancient times of Kizuna Ai. However, the so-called \"Hololive Boom\" made vtubers more popular than ever in the West. This inspired a lot of people to start their vtubing journey. This is where, I think, some people start to take the aforementioned joke seriously: hey, look! I'm a vtuber too because I have these pixels representing the real me. This may be easily disregarded. The harder part comes when streamers or \"content creators\" use avatars during their activities instead of revealing their real faces.</p><p>Is it hard to disregard or acknowledge these online entertainers as vtubers? It can be hard sometimes. This takes us back to the nature of meaning. Well, if we take the word \"vtuber\" in a literal sense, we could say that they are indeed virtual YouTubers. But wait, are they even on YouTube? Some of these vtubers are on other platforms like Niconico, Bilibili, or even Twitch. We see the problem now: we don't take words literally.</p><p>When we use words, there is a certain psychological investment we make. It is as if we are attached to some other properties of the word instead of the word itself. We aren't at the mercy of dictionaries. Rather, we are dictated by the social condition in which we're entangled. This is why people from different communities perceive words differently from each other. This is not necessarily a denial of 'objectivity'. This is also not an attempt to tame plurality. My statement is a rather pessimistic one because the different way of perceiving words is a kind of war. Different communities struggle to seize words and weave their \"version\" of meaning into them.</p><p>The grander way of seeing this is through \"\"\"ideology\"\"\". Now, what does it mean to be an ecologist? This is <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18912.The_Sublime_Object_of_Ideology\">not my idea</a> but someone can be a social ecologist, state-oriented ecologist, conservative ecologist, and many more. Those three are the same yet different. The three aren't always in harmony. They respectively believe that their version of ecologism is the real ecologism while the others are just degenerated variations. The identity of ecologism is, thus, open and only through a certain intervention it can be halted, through a 'war'. Another example is the struggle of democracy: the communists may fight for 'real democracy' to counter the exploitative 'bourgeois formal democracy', despite both being forms of democracy. There are other examples but let's get back to vtubers because I'm but a weeb.</p><p>The same applies to the word \"vtuber\": there is an ongoing war to define what it really is. Vtubers have been closely associated with the otaku culture, or you might say \"\"\"otaku\"\"\". This is why, for some weebs, random online entertainers with avatars aren't necessarily vtubers. What separates these entertainers from 'real' vtubers is the otaku-ness around its fandom, not whether they use avatars to hide their real faces or not. However, that is different for others, preferably non-weebs. For them, any online entertainer with avatars can be a vtuber. For others, only streamers (with avatars of course) can be vtubers. There may be some other ways of defining vtuber that aren't prevalent, but that is for another day.</p><p>That is what I think about vtuber and the struggle to seize its meaning.</p>","date":"2021-10-05T11:13:50.927+07:00","pubDate":"Tue, 05 Oct 2021 11:13:50 +0700","uri":"struggle-to-seize-a-meaning-featuring-vtuber"},{"title":"Mulai Menggunakan Pleroma","description":"<p><em>English TL;DR: I started a Pleroma instance.</em></p><p>Saya baru saja set-up instance Pleroma.

Kita jadi bisa konsoom hiburan kesukaan dengan lebih mudah tanpa harus bersusah payah menggunakan mesin pencari seperti Google. Tidak perlu kita menggali-gali dengan sulitnya untuk menemukan fansub baru ketika kita ingin menonton anime bajakan. Banyak fansub-fansub ini yang memiliki presensi di timeline Facebook atau grup obscure Telegram. Banyak mutual kita di Facebook atau Twitter yang tahu daftar fansub beserta link situs dan/atau Drive mereka. Lagipula, kita (atau mungkin bukan saya) bisa nonton yang legal di YouTube.</p><p>Namun sekarang saya rasa, \"kesederhanaan\" ini justru merusak Internet. Kesederhanaannya justru menjadikan aktivitas Internet kita jadi lebih kompleks. Sekarang kita memiliki tuntutan sosial untuk hadir di berbagai medsos. Setelah selesai webinar tidak jelas, kita bertukar profil Instagram dengan sesama peserta. Setelah beberapa saat berkenalan dengan teman kuliah, kita berbagi handle Twitter.

Atau, mungkin karena ada hasrat untuk hadir di medsos di manapun, kapanpun.</p><p>Baiklah, sampai di situ rambling tidak bijak dari seorang zoomer. Saya ingin membicarakan satu hal lain, tapi serupa. Seperti yang saya bilang tadi, tulisan ini ditujukan bagi orang yang nge-like halaman Facebook saya.

Tempat utama saya sekarang adalah Twitter (ewww) melalui browser dan, mungkin, YouTube sebagai tempat buang berak (pikiran random) tentang budaya dan media seperti biasanya.</p><p>Mungkin saya akan menggunakan halaman Facebook, tapi tidak secara langsung. Ketika saya menulis sesuatu di website saya, akan ada update otomatis seperti ini. Untuk Instagram, lol no. Lain lagi, saya sudah terlanjur menyebar link halaman Facebook dan profil Instagram saya di beberapa video YouTube.
