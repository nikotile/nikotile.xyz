<p>
Here are several updates from me regarding this website, my YouTube channel, and a certain project.
</p>

<h2>Website</h2>
<p>
I'm updating my website soon. It's a pretty big update, I think, so that's why an announcement is necessary. Well, it will only affect you if you've previously subscribed to my RSS feed. If you aren't, then it's not that important and you can skip to the next heading.
</p>
<p>
What's being updated? The whole website! I previously used Luke Smith's <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb">lb</a> for my blog and RSS feed generation. I will switch to my own script(?). Anyway, the current URL for my RSS feed is <a href="https://nikotile.xyz/rss.xml">nikotile.xyz/rss.xml</a> and I will change that to <a href="https://nikotile.xyz/rss">nikotile.xyz/rss</a> soon. If for some reason you're subscribed to my RSS feed, you can prepare to change the URL. The update will be live in less than a week since this writing is posted.
<p>
<p>
With lb gone, the weird <a href="https://nikotile.xyz/2021.html">"rolling blog"</a> page will be gone too! Is it sad? I don't think so, it's a weird feature after all.
</p>

<h2>The Strange Case of YouTube</h2>
<p>
I (have to) assume that some of you find me through YouTube, even if you don't speak English. Let's briefly talk about it.
</p>
<p>
It was a random impulse that led me to create a YouTube channel and post videos there back in 2018. It turned out to be fun for the first year even though I didn't get a lot of attention. I won't get into the details of this "journey". Still, random people would pop in the comment box, expressing their thoughts be it to just simply respond or to laugh at me. You might want to check my first video, the one about Darling in the FranXX, to get an idea of how people interact with me.
</p>
<p>
However, it's 2021 and you might've noticed that I stopped posting frequently. Yes, I'm now bored lol. I realized that I just want to talk to people about anime and media in general, not to create videos every week or so.
</p>
<p>
Gentlemen of the jury, with this I will archive a lot of my videos!
</p>

<h2>Wibu Paradoks and Its Discontent</h2>
<p>
This one is more obscure than my YouTube channel and I think only a few of you know about this.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://wibu.nikotile.xyz">Wibu Paradoks</a> is a collaborative project focused on a literary anthology series I started back in 2018 with some of my friends. In the weeb lingo, it's a doujin circle, sort of. We wrote three amateur anthologies and had tried to sell them in a local comiket-like event. It didn't end well. Our side products like keychains and print art are more successful than the anthology, our main project.
</p>
<p>
When the pandemic hit, the project had de facto ceased to exist. The planned fourth volume of the series was never finished. Our circle members had gone their own way.
</p>
<p>
I planned to reinitiate this project, but as something different, using a different approach as well. I'm still thinking about how but I just want to say that Wibu Paradoks won't die just yet.
